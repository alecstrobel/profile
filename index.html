        <h2>I'm a product designer 🎨 and programmer 🛠</h2>
        <p>I've been working in product design since studying Design Management at the University of the Arts London. I currently specialise in user experience design, but I’m in love with the entire product design process and I‘m looking to grow further by learning to code. My goal is to work as a full-stack developer creating awesome apps that change the world.</p>
